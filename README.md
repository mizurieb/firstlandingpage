# LinktreeCopy
My very first project!

I have been studying by myself about HTML and CSS hoping to one day become a web developer. I have followed online classes at Digital House, and I have been using apps like Sololearn and Mimo frequently to acquire more knowledge and get better while navigating through this new world. So I made my first page, a Liktree copy, where I highlight links to the articles I have written and added other things like my personal contact links following the guidelines on the Mimo project.

I used HTML to place links to social networks, my newly created profile on GitHub and some articles featured on websites that I have written. I used CSS to stylize everything from the background, profile image to buttons and even tried little animations. I love the Linktree style so I am happy that I could  kind of replicate it on this first project.
