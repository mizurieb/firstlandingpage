My first landing page / portfolio page

After several classes seen at Digital House, and using the Sololearn and Mimo apps frequently, I made my first landing page where I highlight links to the articles I have written and my personal contact links.

In this project, mainly following the Mimo model, I used HTML to place links to social networks, my profile on GitHub or various featured articles that I have written and are published on the Internet. I used CSS to stylize everything from the background, profile image to buttons. I love the Linktree style so I am happy that I could  kind of replicate it on this first try.
